A natural question that emerges from this work is a need
for a proof of the main Conjecture.
Furthermore, if a combinatorial proof arises, it could give
the corresponding integer sequence a combinatorial formula
and a combinatorial meaning that does not involve a 
generating series.\\

As for the rational case, future work might include the search
for generalized formulae for the number of intervals in both
posets defined in Section 2.3, whether it is expressed as a
generating series or not.\\

Finally, following the work of \cite{ref9} on parking trees,
one could study the cover relations on rational parking trees.
